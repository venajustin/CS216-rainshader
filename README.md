# Rain Shader project

For CS216 - Physically Based Modelling

Built with (raylib)[https://www.raylib.com/index.html]. Starting point was 
 taken from raylib's (physically based modeling example)[https://www.raylib.com/examples/shaders/loader.html?name=shaders_basic_pbr].

Project goals:
- write a shader that simulates physically based rain in real time on a 3d scene
- rain "streaks" with partical simulation
- rain "splashes" on the ground plane
- puddles with realistic reflections
